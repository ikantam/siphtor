            <p>A backup includes all private keys and public keys (addresses), associated with your Siphtor Wallet. The wallet doesn’t have access to your private or any security-sensitive data. We wouldn’t be able to restore your keys or passwords. Siphtor Wallet is a client interface for interaction with blockchain. That’s why we encourage you to store your keys and passwords as if you had a million dollars on your wallet!</p>
